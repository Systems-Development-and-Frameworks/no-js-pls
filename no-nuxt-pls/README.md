## Installation
Run 
```
npm install
```
to install all depedencies. But be warned it will install ~3200 packages
that are able to break you project without you beeing able to find the issues
easily. Your file manager will love it.

## Run Developer Mode
You can start a dev server with hot reload by running:
```
npm run dev
```

## Build and Deploy
To build the project for deployment run:
```
npm run build
```
in your project directory.  
If you have not generated the static project before run:
```
npm run generate
```
but be careful it takes 100 hours to generate for a simple hello world site.
That's called efficency and good design.  
Finally you can start the project with:
```
npm run start
```
